Frameworks for QuickBooks Desktop using PHP

Currently there is just a shell framework for connecting to QuickBooks Desktop apps via the QuickBooks Web Connector using PHP/MySQL.

The APIs are not complete but do work.

I plan on continuing to update this repo with more entities and further develop out the functions especially error handling.

Ping me with any questions about making this work.
