Frameworks for QuickBooks Desktop using PHP

Currently there is just a shell framework for connecting to QuickBooks Desktop apps via the QuickBooks Web Connector using PHP/MySQL.

It's far from complete but does work.

I plan on continuing to update this framework with more entities and further develop out the functions especially error handling.

Ping me with any questions about making it work.
